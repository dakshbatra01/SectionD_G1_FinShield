## Business Problem

Financial institutions face significant losses due to loan defaults and inefficient borrower screening. This project identifies the key financial and behavioral factors driving loan defaults and develops a data-driven risk segmentation framework to support more effective lending decisions and improved portfolio performance.

**Core Business Question**

> How can we identify high-risk borrowers before loan approval to minimize default rates and financial losses?

**Decision Supported**

> This analysis enables lenders to redesign their loan approval strategy by identifying which borrower profiles should be prioritised, restricted, or offered modified loan terms — replacing the traditional credit-score-first approach with a statistically validated LTV + DTI dual-band policy.

## Key Insights

**1. 1 in 4 Borrowers Defaults — Portfolio Under Systemic Stress**
> The portfolio default rate is **23.72%** — nearly 1 in 4 loans. This is not a borrower-level outlier problem; it signals a structural gap in the underwriting framework that cannot be resolved with incremental fixes.

**2. LTV Is the Only Reliable Numerical Risk Gate**
> `ltv` is the strongest numerical predictor of default (`r=0.0976`, logistic coefficient=0.2239). Very High LTV borrowers (≥90%) default at **35.8%** — more than double the Moderate LTV bucket (16.2%). LTV-based banding is statistically validated (`χ²=451.9`) and is the strongest single gating variable available.

**3. DTI Works Only at the Extremes — Not at the Industry Threshold**
> DTI is the second strongest signal (`r=0.0929`), but the industry-standard 43% cutoff is counterproductive in this portfolio — borrowers below it actually default slightly more (24.3%) than those above (22.1%). Risk only concentrates meaningfully below DTI=35 (13.0% default) and above DTI=50 (40.6%), requiring a dual-band replacement policy.

**4. Credit Score Is Statistically Irrelevant**
> `credit_score` shows near-zero correlation with default (`r=-0.0028`, `p=0.735`). Borrowers rated Excellent default at 23.7% — virtually identical to those rated Poor at 23.9%. The `credit_score_bucket` chi-square test also returned non-significant (`p=0.722`). Score-first screening provides false confidence with no actual risk separation.

**5. Product Features Outperform Borrower Characteristics**
> Lump sum payment (`χ²=498.5`) and negative amortisation (`χ²=363.1`) are the two strongest default predictors in the entire portfolio — stronger than any borrower metric. These are loan design choices, not borrower traits, meaning the institution's own product catalogue is a primary source of default risk.

**6. Lump Sum Payment Is the Highest-Risk Feature at 76.8%**
> Borrowers with a lump sum payment structure default at **76.8%** — 3× the portfolio average. Only 315 such loans exist, yet 242 defaulted. These borrowers make no monthly payments and rely on a future windfall that rarely materialises. This is the single most actionable restriction available.

**7. Negative Amortisation Doubles the Default Rate**
> `neg_ammortization = yes` borrowers default at **43.5%** — nearly double the 23.7% portfolio average. These loans accumulate debt instead of reducing it, directly eroding repayment capacity over time. The strong chi-square association (`χ²=363.1`) confirms this is not coincidence.

**8. North-East and Home Improvement Are Concentrated Loss Pockets**
> The North-East region has the highest default rate at **~33%**, over 11 percentage points above the North region. Home improvement loans default at **~32%**, the highest of any loan purpose — borrowers stack new debt on existing mortgages, amplifying total financial burden. Geographic and purpose-specific controls deliver more targeted loss containment than uniform policy.

**9. Personal Loans Carry Structurally Higher Unsecured Risk**
> Personal loans default at **33.5%** — nearly 12 percentage points above home loans (21.7%). Without collateral backing, these loans have no recovery buffer when borrowers face financial stress. A uniform approval standard across loan types systematically misprices this structural difference.

**10. Risk Tiers Replace Single-Variable Screening**
> The composite `risk_tier` framework (built on LTV, DTI, product features, and behavioural flags) produces clear default rate separation: Very High tier defaults at 45%+ while Low tier defaults at under 10%. This multi-factor segmentation outperforms any single-variable gate and directly supports the LTV + DTI dual-band lending policy.

## Recommendations

| # | Insight | Recommendation | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **LTV & DTI Dual-Band Policy** | Replace the current single-score approval gate with a two-variable threshold system: auto-approve borrowers with LTV < 60% and DTI < 35%; hold for manual review between 60–90% LTV and 35–50% DTI; hard-restrict loans above 90% LTV or DTI above 50%. | Estimated reduction of portfolio default rate from 23.72% to below 20.73%, saving over ₹4.28 Cr in expected loss exposure. |
| 2 | **Credit Score Screening Is Broken** | Retire credit score as the primary approval filter. Replace it with the composite `risk_tier` score built from LTV bucket, DTI band, product flags, and behavioural signals — which produces actual default rate separation unlike credit score bands (23.7% vs 23.9% across all tiers). | Decisions aligned to observed default behaviour instead of a metric with zero statistical predictive power. |
| 3 | **Negative Amortisation Must Be Restricted** | Introduce mandatory eligibility gates for negative amortisation products — minimum LTV < 70% and DTI < 35%, combined with risk-based premium pricing for borderline approvals. At 43.5% default rate with χ²=363.1, this product needs structural controls, not just monitoring. | Reduced structural default risk and a measurable drop in high-tier portfolio concentration. |
| 4 | **Lump Sum Payment Warrants Immediate Halt** | Suspend new lump sum payment approvals pending a portfolio review. At 76.8% default rate across 315 existing loans, this product feature is the single highest-risk element in the portfolio. Existing holders should be proactively migrated to standard amortising structures. | Immediate containment of the most acute default risk in the portfolio with no new capital at risk. |
| 5 | **Region & Purpose Targeted Lending Limits** | Establish a monthly segment watchlist tracking default rates by region × loan type × loan purpose. Apply hard lending caps in the North-East (33% default rate) and on home improvement loans (32% default rate), with enhanced income and DTI verification for new approvals in these segments. | Faster risk containment in known loss pockets and improved capital allocation away from structurally risky segments. |
